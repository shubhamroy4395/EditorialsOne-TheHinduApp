# EditorialsOne-TheHinduApp
I have created this app because I love reading the editorials from the newspaper The Hindu.
Browsing to their website seemed like a hassle so I created this simple app which uses the Volley library to fetch the
two articles and they open in a chrome custom tab when clicked on.

Feel free to copy the code. You just need to change the url and change the json parsing as per your needs.
